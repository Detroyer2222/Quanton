# Quanton

PulsePoint is an organization management platform tailored for the Star Citizen community. It aims to empower organizations to efficiently manage their outposts, track resources, assign jobs, and foster collaboration among members. This project is under active development and will evolve to include many exciting features in the future.

## Features (Planned)

- **Outpost Tracking**: Maintain a detailed overview of all organizational outposts across the Star Citizen universe.
- **Resource Management**: Monitor resources at each outpost, identify shortages, and optimize logistics.
- **Job Requests**: Set up resource or task requests that notify specific members or groups within the organization.
- **Discord Bot Integration**: Seamlessly interact with PulsePoint through Discord, enabling real-time notifications and commands.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilize rich graphs and charts to gain insights into your organization’s operations.

## Current Status

Quanton is in its early stages of development. The website interface and Turso database are being built, and no features are functional at the moment. However, significant progress is being made to bring the vision of this tool to life.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) for a modern, reactive, and fast user interface.
- **Database**: [Turso](https://turso.tech/) for managing data and authentication.
- **Hosting**: Self-hosted on a VPS, managed with [Coolify](https://coolify.io/).
